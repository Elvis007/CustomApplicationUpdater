Custom Application Updater is a custom, skinned application update interface for Adobe AIR. The updater uses Spark skinning, Flash Builder 4, SDK 4.1, and AIR 2.5.  This application replaces the ApplicationUpdaterUI normally used for updating AIR applications.  It greatly reduces the amount of RAM overhead associated with the ApplicationUpdaterUI and offers a way to create your own custom updater skin/graphics.
